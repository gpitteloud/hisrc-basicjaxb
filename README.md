# HiSrc BasicJAXB

A library of XJC plugins and tools to extend JAXB.

## Description

This repository is a fork of [JAXB2 Basics][22]. The original project was developed by the admirable
Alexey Valikov (a.k.a. [Highsource][2]). This repository contains Java projects to build Maven artifact(s)
related to the Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) framework. It is one of a family of repositories
forked from [Highsource][2] that provide tools for JAXB and JPA processing. Repo and artifact names have
been changed to reflect the familial connection between the repositories and to fix a conformance issue
with the original `maven-jaxb2-plugin` name.

### Goals

The initial goals for this fork are:

* Produce a (mostly) warning and error free build under Java 8 and Java 11.
* Provide new build scripts to facilitate installation, deployment and release.
* Use the SLF4J API and SimpleLogger implementation everywhere.
* Release fresh artifacts to Maven Central in the `org.patrodyne.jvnet` group.

### Status

#### Completed

* Obsolete build scripts have been removed.
* New build scripts have been added.
* POMs have been refactored with renamed artifacts.
* POMs have been updated to reduce warnings and errors.
* Configured SLF4J with SimpleLogger as the log framework.
* Updated Java sources to resolve warnings/errors.
* Verification of unit and integration tests.
* Released to Maven Central
	* [Maven Central Repository Search](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.patrodyne.jvnet)
	* [Maven Central Repository Index](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/patrodyne/jvnet/)

#### In Progress

* Planning for next release.
